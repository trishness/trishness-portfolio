React Portfolio

This newly updated portfolio not only includes the most up to date version of the work completed thus far in the course, but was also made using React and is thus a project to be showcased in and of itself. The code is modularized and dynamically created through components. This is a first version of this React Portfolio - one will notice there are some components that I did not have sufficient time to correctly hook up or properly style, but have been left in the repo as a draft for further work. At this time, the portfolio is entirely designed to be viewed on a mobile - styling so that it looks decent on desktop will be my next step, but I am pleased with the product that I have made thus far and am excited to continue developing and optimizing it.
